;; TODO: write a clojurescript frontend that basically calls into all these functions
;; but makes it easier to call them from javascript (for clojurescript these are fine).
;; This frontend is the one that should have the ^:export meta attached,
;; and it should bridge them through a js->clj and clj->js layer.
